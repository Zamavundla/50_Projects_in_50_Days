# 👋 Hey, I'm Showing Up — For Real This Time

## 🎯 50 Projects in 50 Days – My Personal Comeback

It’s not that I stopped coding. I’ve touched projects, tried ideas, built pieces.  
But this — this is different.  
This is **me, showing up intentionally**.  
No rush. No pressure. Just consistent action, creative flow, and structure I can grow through.

This journey isn’t just about code. It’s about **discipline, momentum, and rebuilding confidence** — one project at a time.

### 🌟 Inspiration In My World

There’s a kind of peace in building something from nothing.  
Code gives me a way to **shape the invisible into something meaningful**.

### 🌱 New Life In This World

This is not a reset — it’s a **continuation**.  
I’m stepping back into the world of software with the same energy that got me through nautical charts and dev certificates — just repurposed into pixels, logic, and interaction.

### 🪜 Steps Of Life In This World

Every small win is a step forward.  
A cleaner layout. A fixed bug. A smoother animation.  
Some steps may be small, but they all move me forward.

### 🌌 The Universe

The coding world is vast — just like the ocean I once studied.  
There are depths to explore, patterns to understand, systems to navigate.  
And now I do that through lines of code instead of latitude and longitude.

### 🌍 My World

This repo isn’t just a log of projects — it’s my **journal of growth**.  
It’s where I track the shift from learner to builder. From paused to present.

## ✍🏽 Note to Self

Be patient.  
Stay inspired.  
Take breaks — but always return.  
This time, I am not just building interfaces — I am building **consistency, confidence, and character**.

Let’s build. Let’s learn. Let’s ship.
