            <h1>Rebuilding Through Code: A Journey Back to Self</h1>
                <p>
                     This project marks a meaningful point in my comeback story — not just as a developer, but as someone reconnecting with creativity and purpose.
                     From learning C++, exploring GIS, building dashboards, to mastering React forms — every step brought me back to code, and back to me.
                 </p>

        <h2> The Walk of Life</h2>
        <p>
          Life doesn’t hand us a map. It hands us moments — uncertain, scattered, often incomplete — and invites us to build a path as we go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve walked through classrooms, codebases, shipping decks, and self-doubt. From nautical dreams to digital realities, every step has taught me something different — about learning, about breaking, about building again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is more than lines of code. It’s a footprint — one of many that mark my return to self-discipline, creativity, and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this isn’t just the walk of a developer. It’s the walk of a dreamer who refuses to give up, even when the tide pulls back.
        </p>
        <p><strong><em>Step by step, I’m building something that matters — and I’m becoming someone who does too.</em></strong></p>
