# 🎴 Expanding Cards

This is **Project 1 of 50** in my "50 Projects in 50 Days" challenge.  
It marks my official return to coding — a creative, visual build to remind myself why I started.

## 💡 Project Summary

Expanding Cards is an interactive UI component that displays a set of image panels.  
Clicking a panel expands it while collapsing the others. It’s designed to help understand **flexbox layouts**, **transitions**, and event-driven DOM manipulation.

## 🌱 Why This Project Matters
