# 🌫️ Blur Effect Loading Screen

This project creates a smooth loading screen effect where a background image gradually becomes clear as the loading percentage increases from 0% to 100%.

## 💡 Project Highlights

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**
- Dynamic background blur using JS
- Animated text counter from `0%` to `100%`
- Uses `scale()` utility to interpolate values

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Starts with a blurred image using CSS `filter: blur(25px)`
2. JavaScript increments a `load` counter from `0` to `100`
3. The blur reduces and the loading text fades out as `load` increases
4. Result: the image becomes clearer, simulating a loading transition

## ✨ Inspiration

This project is a visual metaphor: how clarity in life often follows progress step by step. Each percentage loaded is a moment of growth — until everything comes into focus.
