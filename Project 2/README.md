# 🔢 Progress Steps

This is a simple and responsive multi-step progress bar built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It visually shows your progress through a sequence of steps, updating dynamically when you click “Next” and “Prev”.

Part of my personal **"50 Projects in 50 Days"** journey to rebuild and sharpen my frontend skills.
